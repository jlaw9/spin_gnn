# 2021-02-09 Jeff L: Spin & Buried Volume Learning Curve 

Shree ran DFT calculations on the ~3,500 Alpha-Zero reinforcement learning predictions, 
which are larger molecules than any of the original training examples.

We want to see how much the model improves if we re-train the model with the new DFT calculations.
If we gradually increase the # new training examples, we should be able to see if additional examples would further improve the model.
